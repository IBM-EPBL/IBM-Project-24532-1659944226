## Problem Statement 

Many organizations have their own system to record their income and expenses, which they feel is the main key point of their business progress. It is good habit for aperson to record daily expenses and earning but due to unawareness and lackof proper applications to suit their privacy, lacking decision making capacity people areusing traditional note keeping methods to do so. Due to lack of a complete trackingsystem, there is a 2 constant overload to rely on the daily entry of the expenditure andtotal estimation till the end of the month.


The Expense Tracker is a mobile application that allows the users to download in their mobile phones and can be used to track and update their daily costs. So that they can keep track of their earnings. The user can know easily on how much the amount they have spent on the various things for household, clothing and house rentals and we can easily depict the cost to the user using pie charts. Based on this we can keep track of daily expenses that we spent in a single day. Moreover, this is an automated solution for tracking the expenses.
